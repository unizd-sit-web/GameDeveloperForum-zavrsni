# About
GameDeveloperForum is a development forum oriented towards helping developers share and ask things. The site features a category system where each category is a place to talk about a specific topic. For example, there is a Unity category where you can talk about development in the Unity game engine. Each category can then have a large number of threads. Threads are basically questions that users can create in order to start a conversation. It doesn't have to be a question though. Users can also create a thread to share some of their inventions and discoveries or just to talk about something they found very interesting.
